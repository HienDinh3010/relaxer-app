## Relaxer App
I was feeling a bit stressed today, even after taking a walk on the trail. I still need to work on my tasks, but I feel anxious. I tried browsing some websites that might have inhale/exhale guides, but nothing met my expectations. So, I decided to build my own.

It's a relaxing breathing app with a visual director to guide you on when to breathe in, hold, and breathe out.
